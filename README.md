# F1-Lap-Times

Demo app to display F1 lap time data via a Qt GUI

Sample data for the 2024 British Grand Prix collated using information found on the FIA website: https://www.fia.com/events/fia-formula-one-world-championship/season-2024/british-grand-prix/eventtiming-information

- Data analytics:
  - Detect outlier lap times (pit stops, crashes, etc.)
  - Plot moving lap time average
  - Colour coding based on tyre stint
- User able to select required driver(s) data to display on the graph
