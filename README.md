# F1-Lap-Times

Demo app to display F1 lap time data via a Qt GUI

Sample data for the 2024 British Grand Prix collated using information found on the FIA website: https://www.fia.com/events/fia-formula-one-world-championship/season-2024/british-grand-prix/eventtiming-information 

Packaged executable is available: `./F1Stats/build/Desktop-Release/release/F1Stats.exe`

To open the project, please download [Qt Creator](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/get-and-install-qt.html).

## Future Features:
- Automatically pull data from any source (via API)
- Data analytics:
  - Smarter detection of outlier lap times (pit stops, crashes, etc.)
  - Add user interaction:
      - Hover over to view lap time in more details
      - Toggle drivers graphs on and off
      - User can select from a larger dataset
